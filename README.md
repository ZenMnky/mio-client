## Project description:

Mio is a relationship management tool built to help organize and care for personal relationships.

Mio allows users to add relationships, store, and update important information about the person, as well as journal entries about the relationship. 

Log notes about important events in their lives that they've shared with you, about striking experiences that you've shared together, and your personal reflections. 
  
Mio allows users to categorize relationships into intimacy zones. 
  
Next release will add ability to create user accounts and handle authentication.
